# Fine-Tuning Settings
# IMPORTANT: model_name_id must be aligned across experiments for the same window size.
# Recommended convention: model_name_id = "w<WINDOW_MS>ms"  (e.g., w800ms, w1400ms)

model_name_id: "w1400ms" # placeholder; overwrite from script when running window ablations

# If True, retrain inter-session base models even if already present.
retrain_intersessions: true

# Optional: fine-tune a specific base model file inside the base folder.
# If null, it will fine-tune all expected folds (from pre-trained model)
model_ft_name: null
